This is "Root Donation" Product Landing Page

4/5 project for freeCodeCamp.org Responsive Web Design certification and fourth part of my coding portfolio.

For products in this project I decided to go with donation idea to freeCodeCamp.org and Vim text editor because they are free to use, and yet,
very powerful coding career. Links are valid and will take to their websites. 

You can see live project on following URL:

Enjoy!
